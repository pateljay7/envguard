## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript**: All code should be written in TypeScript with proper types
- **ESLint**: Follow the configured ESLint rules
- **Prettier**: Code formatting is handled by Prettier
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for functions, variables, and files
- **Comments**: Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use Jest as the testing framework
- Aim for high test coverage
- Test both success and error cases
- Include integration tests for CLI commands

Example test structure:
```typescript
describe('EnvScanner', () => {
  it('should detect direct env access', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  it('should handle parsing errors gracefully', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```
